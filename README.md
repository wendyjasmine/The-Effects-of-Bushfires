# The-Effects-of-Bushfires Wendy Woodward u3248688
This was my first time putting together an actual website and I relied heavily on the lectures, tutorials and quick google searches to do it, considering that I would say that this project was done pretty well. *To be viewed on a 1920 x 1080p display on chrome only please.*

## Formatting
 I had a lot of problems with learning about divs and classes and when to put a div in, I would say I put in an unnecessary amount of div tags which made the overall work a bit clunky. I also did not utilise the class aspect very well, I should have given one class for all the headings and another for all the other chunks of text to makeit easier. I also could have condensed a lot of the css by being more efficient with my planning as that made it hard to debug. I also did not know what to name everything so the naming of my elements and divs are very inconsistent.

## Presentation
I think overall all the colours and images are very fitting, the sound effects add an extra touch, as does the burnt bark in the background. These simple touches elevate
the theme a little, along with the consistent colour scheme that contrasts nicely together. I constructed a few of the elements myself using photoshop and illustrator to
add an extra bit of artistic flare which I think suited nicely. 

## Content
I managed to put a fair bit of information into the website which informs the reader well. It is not very extensive however becasue I wanted the website to be more simple, there is onyl a few facts for each panel and 3 panels in total. However I think by adding a link at the end that justifies it. 

## Flexibility 
I did not do well on making the project universal, it only works on a 1920 x 1080p display on chrome. Next time I will be using more percentages and viewwidth measures I just had a lot of trouble making everything line up the way I wanted to. 

## Interactivity & Javascript
I tried to make each panel interactive, the first being an animated button, 2 scrollable divs and 1 navigated by 4 buttons. I could have been more adventurous with my 
javascript use as I only used simple functions but I like how the sound decreases based on the window position, I thought that was a nice touch. My only worry is that the viewer might not know when to scroll or click a button which is why I added scrollbars and hover functions but I could have been clearer with the intention by saying
"scroll" or "press this" after a few seconds.

Overall I think I did a decent job of this assignment, there is much room for improvement of course, particularly in the formatting flexibility for different displays and sites but I am satisfied with the outcome.
